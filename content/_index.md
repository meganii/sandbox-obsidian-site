## Explore the knowledge base

This starter demonstrates how to structure documentation with a familiar three-column layout. Use the sidebar to explore sections, read guides in the center pane, and follow along with the table of contents on the right.

### Getting around

- **Docs** host conceptual material and reference pages.
- **Guides** dive into workflows with practical examples.
- The **search** box is ready for wiring into your preferred search solution.

Continue to the documentation section to explore the example content.
